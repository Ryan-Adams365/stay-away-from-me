# Introduction
The Stay Away From Me (SAFM) app is a cross platform social distancing mobile app. SAFM listens for incoming Bluetooth signals, determines if they are coming from a phone and determines the distance the user is away from those signals. This data is then used in a Proximity Gauge, which changes color and vibrates is the user is getting too close to another device (like another person running this app). It also counts the number of nearby devices, so the user has a better idea of how crowded the area is.
